# Hello this code is terrible, don't learn from it, I will rewrite and make it way better.
### FYI: This isn't 100% universal, there are bugs on almost every season and some seasons have no support at all.<br> <a href="https://discord.gg/reboot">Discord Server</a>.

# Supported Versions
Currently Supported: ~S4-S15<br>

# PLANS

Add an auto pattern finder, this was in development and it's easy to make, it's just time consuming.<br>
Clean up Project and add comments to the code.<br>

# CURRENT ISSUES

Code is everywhere.<br>
Console Colors are a 30/70.<br>

# CONTRIBUTING

In order to find a UFunction, please use UObject->Function("FunctionName") instead of FindObject("Function ...").<br>
Test your code.<br>
If your code edits some existing code, lets say inventory, explain what it does.
